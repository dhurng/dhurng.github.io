Functions include creating appointments, viewing patient information, writing prescriptions, and much more. This project was built using the popular Hibernate Framework (ORM) with hql queries that would persist object states to a DBMS, which in this case MySQL.

Using the Hibernate ORM Framework for CRUD operations as well as designing my UML diagrams, objects were able to be stored within the MySQL database. Furthermore, the clients can access the resources which are representated in XML, by relying on the REST API. The web services were implemented using JPA for hibernate and JAX-RS which was deployed within Java EE-certified application server such as Oracle Web Logic in this case." src="http://www.pdfbook.co.ke/images/books/rest5219979thumb.jpg"></a>
